👋 Hi, I’m Philipp — a Cloud Developer, Cloud-Native Enthusiast, and advocate of Modern Software Engineering.
I love building scalable systems, automating everything, and keeping things clean — in code and in design.

When I’m not diving into Kubernetes clusters or fine-tuning CI/CD pipelines, you’ll probably find me behind a camera, practicing Kung Fu, or spending time with my family — the best ways to stay grounded, focused, balanced, and creative.

Always learning. Always evolving. Always in the cloud ☁️
